# Module Information Display System

A tool to make displaying module information easier for teachers and students

## Made for 2022/23 Final Year Project at University of Portsmouth

### Abstract From Final Report
The current system of which module and course information is stored on university systems is an
inconsistent and often frustrating mess, with minimal thoughts of students use in mind.
The point of this project is to create a new method for laying out this information,
giving teachers an easy method to design module information that will be stored in a
way to allow customization, allowing students to view the information in ways that is best
for them without requiring massive time investment from staff. In time this system could revamp how
all course information is stored on the university website and related sites (such as the course catalogue)
to allow for a much more user-friendly experience and informative layout that is friction-less to traverse.

To deal with the limited time to accomplish this, the goal for this specific project is a simple prototype
which can demonstrate the ability to easily create and save this data and manipulate it into different
forms. Unfortunately, time was more of an issue than expected, however the final result of this project
should still be a helpful start in the development of the originally planned system. A simple UI was able
to be created with the ability to link nodes and save information in a triple format which was used to
allow the simple manipulation of data by being able to convert it from the mind map of the designed
website to a force directed graph, which shows that with some more time and tinkering this can easily
be adapted to create more comprehensive methods of viewing a sprawling web of information.
With a focus on better categorization and creation of data, as well as how best to manipulate this best
for students and teachers being the next focus for the project.
